The idea of CBLiteConsole is to make Couchbase-Lite apps easier to debug by creating something easily dropped into apps which can:

* Show the contents of the local db
* Show stats about the db
* View logs
* View status of replications and trigger replications

# Status

None of this is working yet, in progress.

# Include in your projects

Add as a submodule .. more docs coming soon.
